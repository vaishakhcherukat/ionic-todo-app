# Ionic todo

Mobile App with AngularJS and Ionic. This is a demo app based on https://scotch.io/tutorials/create-your-first-mobile-app-with-angularjs-and-ionic

I noticed the article is lack of example. I created this repo to help those who are having difficulty following the article like I was before. There a some typo in the code and missing methods.


## Installation

1. Clone repo
2. run 'npm install -g cordova ionic' if you don't have it installed
2. run 'bower install'


## Usage

Preview
'ionic serve --lab'
